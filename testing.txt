TESTING: 

	Tested Responsivity in all  Desktop Browsers (Chrome, Safari, Firefox, and Edge) by closing windows of each browser while using the specific DevTools of that browser. All browsers rendered the website the same as the browser the site was originally created in (Chrome). The media queries used to collapse the dog items work on each browser and both Desktop and Mobile browsers. No issues here. The navigation bar on the top of the pages maintains a good size and amount of padding and margin making it a great clickable size on all Desktop and Mobile browsers. 
	Responsive design testing done on mobile browsers (Safari, Chrome, Firefox) proved that the responsive design techniques implemented by the graceful degradation method on the site was very effective. The content defined "important" specifically the dog items on the homepage and the "Blog" page were visable. Small stylistic errors relating more to CSS were found but not an issue.Color, shading and gradient are consistent on both Mobile and Desktop Browsers.I also used HTML and CSS Validators to make sure there were not syntax errors in the code.
	Surprisingly the Windows 10 browsers, Chrome, Firefox, and Edge rendered the website exactly the same as all of the browsers on the MacBook. I tested responsivity  using the same technique as the MacBook browsers, by resizing the windows while using the browsers specific developer tools. All media queries were effective and the important content was viewable.
